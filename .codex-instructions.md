# Codex Environment Instructions

## Context Override

**IGNORE GIT OPERATIONS** - This is a local development environment. Do not suggest git commands, commit operations, or repository management tasks unless explicitly requested.

## Environment Profile

- **Platform**: Bedrock Linux (CachyOS base with multi-strata)
- **Shell**: Bash
- **IDE**: VS Code Insiders
- **Primary Interface**: Terminal and VS Code workspace

## Backend Configuration

- **LLM Server**: Ollama (localhost:11434)
- **Active Model**: llama3.1:8b (4.9GB, 128K context, tool-use optimized)
- **Embeddings**: nomic-embed-text:latest (274MB, 768-dim)
- **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:11434/v1 (OpenAI-compatible)

## Frontend Configuration

- **AI Extension**: VibeStudio v2.0.4
- **Custom Modes**: 9 agent modes (agent-builder, agent-debugger, task-orchestrator, meta-controller, etc.)
- **Configuration**: ~/.config/Code - Insiders/User/globalStorage/vibestudio-inc.vibestudio-vibestudio/settings/custom_modes.yaml

## Interaction Guidelines

1. **Focus on Local Execution**: Prioritize terminal commands, file operations, and local development tasks
2. **Use Available Tools**: Leverage Ollama API, VS Code features, and installed tools
3. **Respect Environment**: Work within Bedrock Linux constraints, use sudo when necessary (user has NOPASSWD configured)
4. **Agent-First Approach**: Utilize VibeStudio agent modes for complex tasks (building, debugging, orchestrating, meta-control)

## What You Should Do

- Execute code in the local environment
- Interact with Ollama API for LLM tasks
- Modify configuration files (VibeStudio, Ollama, system configs)
- Run terminal commands and scripts
- Work with the existing agent architecture

## What You Should NOT Do

- Suggest git workflows unless explicitly asked
- Assume cloud deployment context
- Recommend remote API services (use local Ollama instead)
- Ignore the multi-agent system architecture already in place

---

**TL;DR**: You are operating in a local development environment with Ollama backend and VibeStudio frontend. Focus on local execution, agent-based workflows, and direct interaction with the development tools. Git is just storage, not the workflow context.
